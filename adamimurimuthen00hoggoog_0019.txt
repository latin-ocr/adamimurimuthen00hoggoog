work is now for the> first time published, it is ,but
just to mention. that a large proportiones this
matter consists os documento and letters, some
os which have already been published in Rymer’s
collectione, and some sew are to bo found in
Heame's edition ol Robert of Aveshnry.
Hearne has also, as has heen noticed, given us
the first three years (1337-9) of this additional

hitherto been, to say the least, equivocal: nor is
the consequence lese, that the authorship has
been traced to one whose matured judgment and
truthful character is entitled to greater authenti·

holograph: but certainly the first portion, as-
cribed to Trivet‚ was not written by him, whose
genuine annals end with the reign of Edward Ι. ;
nor has it any resemblance to that work.1 At
the point where the compilor (for this is evident-
