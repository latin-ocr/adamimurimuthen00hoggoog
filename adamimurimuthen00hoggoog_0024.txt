subsequent work hythe latter author3 but as
that editor was not aware that Murimuth's
genuine narrative proceeds ten years beyond the
point where his MS. concludes nor that the
period of Adam’s death is approximately known,
this supposition cannot be received. Hall's oau-
tion in qualifying this conjecture as dubious adds
much to his deserved reputation; and this the
moroso, as the narrative 'oi this Continuator pro-
ceeds consecutively with the year after that oi
the undoubted work of Murimuth.¹

ξ’ 9. The anonymous author of this Continua-
tion commences, as we have mentioned, with the
year next following that on which Hall’s MS. of
Murimuth terminatas,viz.in1337; and thence
continues consecutively till the year 1380. lt
will be observed that the early years os this
Chronicle, more especially the first ten years
(which are treated. at large in the additional

matteras the present-edition os Murimuth), are ,

passed over with great brevity 3 nor is this brevity
much enlarged till about the year 1359, from
which time it may be supposed that the Ι author,

, if contemporary, began to be more immediately

conversant with- the events he narrates. Hall
conjectures that this work is by a contemporary:
and assuredly‚as theGhronicle advances‚ the inter·-

, ¹ nal evidence (for there is· no other) isin favour of

this supposition, and becomes more apparent
from the year 1367 to its completion. In· this
conjecture we acquiesce, but with some qualili-
cation. Hall's edition continues without a break
at the year oi the accession of Richard II. An.

¹As this MS. is one of great period, it seems likely to have
beauty andoareful execution, and been a copy of a preceding origi-
must have been written subse- nal, which woudd‚ inthis suppo-
que'ntly' to tbe' year 1³8⁰, though sitien, necessarily have been the
apparently not long aiter that work oiacontemporary historiari.
