3. Cod. Reg. 13 A. xvm. 4, is very valuable, ufi‘aum‘
and evidently a MS. 'ol the fourteenth century.
It will be perceived that we bava made much use
of this MSas the foundation of the additional

and is in some passages, from erasure and other
causae, occasionally hard to decipher.⁹

foregoing MSS. ; but it is a work of much greater
care, and more beautifully transcribed. It is
written in a large sair hand, in double columns,
large folio, (containing 267 leaves) and is illumi-

mencing with that of Matthew os Westminster.
