XX PREFAGE.

the reign ο1 Edwurd ΠΙ. and the commencement
of that ο1 Richard ΙΙ. is due to an intermediate

’ and therefore contemporary author.¹

papnnu- os the concluding portion from 1359, or, at least,

from 1367, (p. 203), will necessarily be greatly
enhanced. From p. 211 to the conclusion of the

Bentley and Co. He has also in a particular
manner to express his obligatior to the gentle·
man who so ably superintends the reading de·
partmeut, sor his valuable assistance and sugges·
tione, especially respecting those passageswhich,
from the state os the MSS„ were occasionally
faulty, and osten obscure.
