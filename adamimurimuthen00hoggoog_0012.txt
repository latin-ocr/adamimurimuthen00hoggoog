ought at least to have read the annale which

they profess to give an account of. Nor is it

commences

In the preface¹ to the following work, the

inin annalist informs us that he was induced to write

¹¹' a Chronicle, from the circumstance ol his having

experienced the wantos such a work ; no author

at that time having written aunals which came

. down to a later period than the year 1305: and

, that accordingly he had collected materials, and

written down ina succinet· manner such sub*

sequent events ‘out of the hook of his own days,'

as he quaintly expresses it, from the period he

was capable oi duly weighing the several facts

· which came under 'his notice. He then con·

cludes by assuring us that, with the exception oi

the first three years of his annuis, lece-1306,

(which he borrowcd from an anonymous Chroni-

cle he found at westminster,) his narrative was·

composed of facts which he had either heard

srom credible authority, or had himself been
personally a witness to.
